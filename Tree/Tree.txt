Node - Contains value in a tree.

Root - The top node of the tree.

Leaf - Nodes which do no have any children.(Also can be described as the nodes 
who have degree as 0).

Child - Nodes below a certain node is called child of that node.

Parent - Node above a certain node is called parent of a node.

Decendant - Considering that node a root, all the nodes that are forming a tree 
are called the decendant of that particular node.

Ancestors - Topmost node above that certain node is called ancestors.

Degree - Number of children of a particular node is called degree of that node.

Internal Node - Everything other than Leaf node is called a internal node.

2 Types of searches :-
-Breath First Search(Level Order)
-Depth First Search

3 Types of Depth First Search :-

*InOrder
*PreOrder
*PostOrder

InOrder (Left Root Right)
PreOrder (Root Left Right)
PostOrder (Left Right Root)

    10
   /  \
  20  30

InOrder : 20 10 30
PreOrder : 10 20 30
PostOrder : 20 30 10

Q) Find the InOrder, PreOrder, PostOrder of the following graph

           10
          /  \
         20  30       
        /  \   \
       40  50  60
          /  \
         70  80

Ans) 
*InOrder -> 40 20 70 50 80 10 30 60
*PreOrder -> 10 20 40 50 70 80 30 60
*PostOrder -> 40 70 80 50 20 60 30 10
